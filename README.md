# GIPHY-API
This is my GIPHY API using JavaScript

My name is Jorge G Reyes and this is my GIPHY API project for my bootcamp.

People using this page of my project can search for gifs using GIPHY and can then navigate through my portfolio through the top. 

In this project I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I linked Bootstrap through CDN and Google Fonts as well

I plan to improve upon APIs by hopefully doing a Marvel Comic one later on and hope to implement this into the files for my portfolio so that they are all hosted together. I also would like to make it so that I can switch between all the APIs I make by a press of a button and staying on that same page.
